<p>There are several ETL tools on the market, some of them open source. When evaluating, in addition to cost and ease of integration, ensure that you evaluate support. Particularly with open source tools, look at the size of the community around the tools as they will be the ones maintaining the base software, as well as possibly helping your team with their technical questions.</p>

<p>Some options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talend</li>

<li>Pentaho</li>

<li>Informatica</li>

<li>CloverETL</li>

<li>KETL</li>
</ul>

<p>Write your own series of scripts to do ETL - this is not recommended if you do not have a technical team that can develop and support these scripts.</p>
