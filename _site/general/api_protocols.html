<h1 id='protocols'>Protocols:</h1>

<p>By default your web services should communicate via HTTP over SSL. You should have a pretty good reason for diverging from that.</p>

<p>There are two main options of protocols to use for your API, REST and SOAP.</p>

<h2 id='rest'>REST</h2>

<p>A protocol that reuses the HTTP verbs and describes resources by URLs. (Simple, right?) For more information, check out <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST'>wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h2 id='soap'>SOAP</h2>

<p>An XML based protocol often found in enterprise/banking applications. For more information including a list of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP#Technical_critique'>advantages/disadvantages</a>, check <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP'>wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Most modern APIs are adhering to a RESTful format, rather than using SOAP. With that in mind, REST may be a more cofortable default protocol.</p>

<p>Both REST and SOAP should be well supported by clients.</p>
