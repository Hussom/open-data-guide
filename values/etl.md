#ETL tools

##What is ETL
ETL stand for Extract, Transform, Load and is set of tools or processes around doing exactly that:

* _Extracting_ the data from someplace (usually a database)
* _Transform_ the data from the format that it started into a different format
* _Load_ the data someplace (usually a different database)

##ETL Options

###Commercial



###Open Source
There are several well tested Open Source options. Cost of open source tools is usually lower than commercial options. You should look at the size of the community around the tools as they will be the ones maintaining the base software, as well as possibly helping your team with their technical questions.

Some options:
* Talend
* Pentaho
* CloverETL
* KETL

###Roll Your Own
Write your own series of scripts to do ETL - this is not recommended if you do not have a technical team that can develop and support these scripts.
