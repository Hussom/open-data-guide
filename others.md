#Other Guides:
=============

##[Civic Commons Open Data Guidelines:](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Open_Data_Guidelines)

##[Open Data Commons:](http://opendatacommons.org/guide/)
This guide is focused on adding data to the Open Data Commons run by the Open Knowledge Foundation. It goes over the process of adding an existing dataset to their commons (opening it) and applying the appropriate license. It does not go into any technical detail about how to put together a dataset that can be opened.

##[Open Data Handbook:](http://opendatahandbook.org/)
This is another handbook published by the Open Knowledge Foundation. It talks more about how to pick datasets that should be made open and then how to publicize their openness. It does not go into any technical detail about how to put together an open dataset.

##[Socrata Open Data Field Guide:](http://www.socrata.com/open-data-field-guide-chapter/about/)
This is a finely detailed guide for a government to open their data. It goes through all the social processes of opening data including building the impetus for opening data and creating a community around it. It also does not go into technical detail if you are the tech guy in charge of opening up data, although it gives links to examples of governments that have opened data through Socrata.

##[Google Open Transit Guide:] (http://maps.google.com/help/maps/mapcontent/transit/)
Focuses solely on publishing transportation data in General Transit Feed Specification.  Very detailed how-to for a very specific task.  Although an excellent guide, it would be difficult to use this for any other kinds of data sets.

##[Open Government Data (Josh's Book)] (http://opengovdata.io/) 
Excellent, comprehensive guide to Open Data. Case studies illustrate the "how" to some extent, but concentrates more on the "why."  Probably too long for our target audience to consume.
