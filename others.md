##[Civic Commons Open Data Guidelines:](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Open_Data_Guidelines)

##[Open Data Commons:](http://opendatacommons.org/guide/)

##[Open Data Handbook:](http://opendatahandbook.org/)
Provides an excellent "why" guide but not so much with the "how to" information.

##[Socrata Open Data Field Guide:](http://www.socrata.com/open-data-field-guide-chapter/about/)

##[Google Open Transit Guide:] (http://maps.google.com/help/maps/mapcontent/transit/)
Focuses solely on publishing transportation data in General Transit Feed Specification.  Very detailed how-to for a very specific task.  Although an excellent guide, it would be difficult to use this for any other kinds of data sets.

##[Open Government Data (Josh's Book)] (http://opengovdata.io/) 
Excellent, comprehensive guide to Open Data.  Case studies illustrate the "how" to some extent, but concentrates more on the "why."  Probably too long for our target audience to consume.
