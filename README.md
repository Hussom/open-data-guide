## Open Data Guide

A guide for opening common datasets. This was built at the Mozilla-Knight-MIT Hack Day, June 2013.

--------------

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (so you'll need up to date versions of [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Each markdown file contains the steps for opening that type of data. Jekyll takes each of these and inserts them into a template and builds the html.
